# Evolutionary Computing Toolbox

## Setup
This project is based on python and uses [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
to manage the virtual environment. If you do not have pipenv yet, you can install it
with `pip install --user pipenv`. 

To create the virtual environment or to update dependencies, execute `pipenv install`. 
In order to activate the virtual environment, execute `pipenv shell`.
