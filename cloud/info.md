# Evolution on the cloud

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)
AWS has a program for students named AWS Educate which grants access to some of their resources, albeit with some restrictions. You receive $30 credits and the usage costs will be deducted from this balance. The services that are available to use are: <https://s3.amazonaws.com/awseducate-starter-account-services/AWS_Educate_Starter_Accounts_and_AWS_Services.pdf>. The applicable costs for the instances are given here: <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/>. Powerful instances, for example with 8 vCPUs and 32 GB memory are quite expensive. Considering it costs $0.37/hr, it's possible to use it only for ~80 hours. You can apply for the program here: <https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/>. It doesn't require a credit card.

## Microsoft Azure
Azure also provides a student account with $100 credit. The pricing details are here: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/>. You can create an account here: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/#free-products-section>. It doesn't require a credit card too.

## Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
This one doesn't have a student account but instead provides free credit for research. It requires submission of project details and the application has to be submitted by a faculty member. Grants are made at Google's discretion. Details here: <https://cloud.google.com/edu/>.

**Note**: All three of them also have a 'free tier' account which does provide more credits but requires users to give their credit card details.

PS - Do not forget to turn off the instances when not in use. It can waste credit unnecessarily.
